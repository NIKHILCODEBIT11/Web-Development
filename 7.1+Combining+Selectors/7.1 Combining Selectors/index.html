<!--
Combining CSS selectors allows you to apply styles to specific HTML elements more precisely. Here's a breakdown of different ways to combine selectors in CSS:

(i) Grouping selector :-

🔹 1. Grouping Selector :-

Apply the same style to multiple selectors:

h1, h2, p {
  color: blue;
}
This styles all <h1>, <h2>, and <p> elements with blue text.

✅ In a grouping selector, you can include any valid CSS selectors — not just HTML elements, but also:

Classes (.classname)

IDs (#idname)

Pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child, etc.)

Attribute selectors ([type="text"], etc.)

Even complex combinations (div > p.highlight)

-->


<!--

In CSS, a child combinator selector is used to select elements that are direct children of a specific parent.

🔹 Syntax:

parent > child {
  /* styles */
}
The > symbol is the child combinator.

It matches only elements that are direct children, not deeper nested ones.


ex :-

<div class="parent">
  <p>I'm a direct child.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I'm a grandchild.</p>
  </div>
</div>


.parent > p {
  color: red;
}

🔍 Result:
Only the first <p> (direct child of .parent) will be red.

The second <p> inside <div> won’t be affected (it's a grandchild, not direct).


-->


<!--
(iii) Descendant :-  


🟦 Descendant Combinator Selector in CSS :-

The descendant combinator selector in CSS selects all elements that are nested inside a particular element, at any depth.

A B {
  /* styles */
}


This means:

Select all <B> elements that are inside any <A> element,

Even if <B> is deeply nested (not just a direct child).


Ex :-

<div class="parent">
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <div>
    <span>This is a span</span>
  </div>
</div>

.parent span {
  color: red;
}


✅ The span is inside .parent (even though it’s inside a nested div),
➡️ So it gets red color.


🔁 Difference from Child Combinator (>)
Descendant (A B): Selects all levels of children.

Child (A > B): Selects only immediate children.

📌 Summary:
A B = all <B> elements inside <A>, any level deep.

It’s very commonly used in styling nested structures like menus, cards, etc.

<!--

(iv) Chaining selector :-

:
🟩 Chaining Selector in CSS :-

A chaining selector (also called a compound selector) lets you apply styles to an element that matches multiple conditions at the same time — like having a specific tag, class, and/or ID together.

syntax :-

selector1selector2selector3 {
  /* styles */
}

######### Ther's no space between selctors.

📘 Example:

<p class="highlight important">Hello!</p>

p.highlight.important {
  color: red;
}
✅ This will style the <p> element only if it has both highlight and important classes.


🔁 Common Uses:
Selector                                            	Meaning
div.box	                                      A <div> with class box
p#intro	                                     A <p> with ID intro
input[type="text"].active	            An <input> of type text with class active

❌ Not Chaining:

div .box
This is a descendant selector, not chaining. There’s a space, so it means:

Select elements with class .box that are inside a <div>


********** I can't insert ANY HTML ELEMENT IN MIDDLE AS SELECTOR IN CHAINING SELECTOR

EX :-

.class1.class2#id1p     here, p is aragraph element which must come at start only.
p.class1.class2#id1       It is correct

EVEN I CANT INCLUDE MORE THAN 1 HTML ELEMENT IN CHAINING SELECTOR

📌 Summary:
Chaining selector = Combine multiple selectors with no space.

All conditions must be true on the same element.

Useful for writing precise styles.
